# Trading_Toolkit_KNN

This is a machine learning based indicator, strength at identifying trends by predicting the moving average, VWAP and ATR. The reason why KNN is that we have sufficient tools in statistics to optimize it and eventually achieve self-optimization. I have an idea written down in python and I am sure there is a way to use pinescript calling the data from Tradingview. 

the Pinescript flie is a runable code in Tradingview. The Python file is a draft attempt yet ready to be converted to pinescript and practice in the market.
